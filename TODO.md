## TODO's

### Major

- fix example programs 
    - ~~and potentially add them to a new `doc` directory (a la tiger)~~
- ~~add more strength reductions to BinaryExp~~
- another non-trivial optimization not in tiger
    - toal suggested 'Can you throw in getting rid of statements after a return maybe? Then you can have the 5 points back. Let me know.'
- subscripted shit still not working (see `doc/dictsListsAndSets.ink`)

### Minor

- 100% branch coverage
- (maybe) add a generator for arrow functions that generates actually js arrow functions
- empty lists, sets, and dicts have no type
- fix string iteration in a for loop
