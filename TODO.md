## TODO's

### Major

- fix example programs 
    - and potentially add them to a new `doc` directory (a la tiger)
- add more strength reductions to BinaryExp
- another non trivial optimization not in tiger
    - toal suggested 'Can you throw in getting rid of statements after a return maybe? Then you can have the 5 points back. Let me know.'

### Minor

- 100% branch coverage
