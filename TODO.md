## TODO's

### Major


### Minor

- (maybe) add a generator for arrow functions that generates actually js arrow functions
- better generator for range?
- ~~fix string iteration using a for loop~~
- can't have any kind of add, sub, etc operators in subscripted call :(
- change const var-decs to follow `id "always" "is" Type Exp` pattern?????
- could add optimization to treat `always` var-decs as literals
- I think beautify is adding spaces in between postfix and prefix ops and operands (ie -5 becomes --> `- 5`)
- can't subscript function calls that return collection (dicts at least)
